# Civic Issue Reporting System

The **Civic Issue Reporting System** is a city-specific digital platform that enables residents to report civic problems and helps city officials manage and resolve these issues efficiently. It is designed to foster citizen engagement, promote transparency, and support data-driven decision-making for urban infrastructure and services.

Currently, the system is implemented for a single city but is architected with scalability in mind for multi-city expansion and broader civic use cases such as public safety alerts and emergency response coordination.
